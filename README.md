## NGS workflow using STAR tool and DESeq2

### Introduction
The goal of this study is to analyze RNA sequences in human cells for the TDP-43 protein, specifically comparing wild-type (WT) and knockout (KO) samples. We will perform expression profiling using high-throughput sequencing and conduct downstream analysis in R using the DESeq2 approach.
